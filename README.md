# lein-bom

A Leiningen plugin to collect dependencies in the fantasy format called BOM.

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/de.active-group/lein-bom.svg)](https://clojars.org/de.active-group/lein-bom)

## Usage

Check out this repository and, from within the root directory of this project,
run:

```shell
lein install
```

Then put the following into the `project.clj` file of the project you
want to generate a BOM for

```clojure
:plugins [[de.active-group/lein-bom "0.2.4"]]
```

and then run, also in that project's root dir:

```shell
lein bom
```

If you want to explicitly ignore some dependencies, you can specify them as
arguments after the call to lein bom.
Example: If you want to ignore `org.clojure/clojure` and
`org.clojure/clojurescript` in the output, run

```shell
lein bom org.clojure/clojure org.clojure/clojurescript
```

This will hopefully generate `bom.json` -- this file contains the bom
entries for this project.  Dependencies that are specified in
`project.clj` under `:dependencies` will be included, but please read
the following note carefully.

### Note on `profiles.clj`

The `leiningen` internals always merge everything specified in the
`:dependencies` in your `profiles.clj` (located at
`~/.lein/profiles.clj` on non-Windows).  If you need the project's
dependencies *without* your personal ones you need to temporarily
remove them from your `profiles.clj`.  In the future, perhaps we will
find a way around this.
