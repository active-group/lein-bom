# lein-bom

A Leiningen plugin to collect dependencies in the fantasy format called BOM.

## Usage

Check out this repository and, from within the root directory of this project,
run:

    $ lein install

Then, in the project you want to generate a BOM for, run:

    $ lein bom

This will hopefully generate `bom.json` -- this file contains the bom entries
for this project.
