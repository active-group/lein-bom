# lein-bom

A Leiningen plugin to collect dependencies in the fantasy format called BOM.

## Usage

Check out this repository and, from within the root directory of this project,
run:

    $ lein install

Then, in the project you want to generate a BOM for, run:

    $ lein bom

If you want to explicitly ignore some dependencies, you can specify them as
arguments after the call to lein bom.
Example: If you want to ignore `org.clojure/clojure` and
`org.clojure/clojurescript` in the output, run

    $ lein bom org.clojure/clojure org.clojure/clojurescript

This will hopefully generate `bom.json` -- this file contains the bom entries
for this project.
Only dependencies that are specified in the project's `project.clj` under
`:dependencies` will be included.

### Note on `profiles.clj`

The `leiningen` internals always include everything specified in your
`profiles.clj` (on MacOS and probably Linux, this is found under
`~/.lein/profiles.cljs`) under `:dependencies`.
If you want to have the pure output from this tool, you need to temporarily
remove all `:dependencies` from our `profiles.clj`.
In the future, perhaps we will find a way around this.
